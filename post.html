			<h3>Self-Study</h3>
			<span class="meta"><em>(April 14, 2018)</em></span>		
			<p>As much as I am committed to self-learning for my career, there are many challenges that are keeping me from making the best out of this technique. In this internet age, knowledge is so affordable and many times, completely free.
			<ul>
				<li>Many classes from top universities like Stanford, Harvard, MIT or Caltech  are completely free</li>
				<li>Experts are enthusiastic to share their knowledge on Youtube for anyone who are willing to spend some time to learn (instead of watching cat videos).</li>
				<li>Udemy offers many computing classes at a staggering low cost (most of the courses I purchased were on sale for $10-$12 with cashback)</li>
				The question here is how can we take advantage of all these resources. Here are some of my challenges.
				<li>Free technical ebooks are everywhere, especially in Data Sciencne subjects.</li>
				</ul>
				<ol>
					<li><h6>Time commitment</h6>
						I found the investing time is more difficult that investing money. I paid for Udemy classes but completed only a few of them. Some of them still stay untouched. I admit that by looking at my collection is satisfying. But that can keep me from actually <em>using</em> them. Some of them are not in my priority, so I still don't have the time to study.</li>
					<li><h6>Not enough background</h6>
						Some of the advanced classes like Machine Learning or Deep Learning in universities, I got stuck along the way and could not continue.</li>
					<li><h6>Not relevant to work (yet)</h6>
					Classes like AWS, PostgreSQL, or Spark are right now not related to any of my work. I know sooner or later I will have to apply them, but lack of work and practice makes the materials dull and easy to forget.</li>
					<li><h6>Lack of instruction</h6>
					Sometimes because I cannot ask anyone to clarify the materials, I feel discouraged and stop studying.</li>
				</ol>
					So how can I make self-learning effective?
						<ul>
							<li>Appreciate the vast amount of learning materials I can obtain for free or at a super low cost.</li>
							<li>But don't let the huge size of these resources to overwhelm me. Accept that I cannot read, listen or watch everything.</li>
							<li>Prioritize only 2 most important and relevant courses to study at a time and and learn it well.</li>
							<li>Set up a schedule for each course and stick with it.</li>
							<li>Make use of Q&A, comments and forum. Most of the questions I have cannot be found online. If necessary, email the instructors.</li>
							<li>Before learning a topic that may relate to work later, research how I can use what I'm about to learn to make some interesting use cases.</li>
							
						</ul>

			<h3>Got Certified for RPA (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robotic_process_automation" target="_blank">Robotic Process Automation</a>)</h3>
			<span class="meta"><em>(April 10, 2018)</em></span>		
			<p>Two weeks ago, I did not know what RPA was. I thought it was a development software inside of robots. I was so lucky that my coworkers signed me up for the training at <a href="http://www.automationanywhere.com" target="_blank">Automation Anywhere</a>. After two weeks (and one failed attempt, I admit), I am now certified as an Advanced Professional in the field. I learned the necessary skills that will help me to start a project for RPA very soon. There are many challenges ahead, but I am committed to study whatever it takes to take on these challenges. The next thing to study is likely to be the famous IBM Watson platform.</p>

			<h3>Health Comes First</h3>
			<span class="meta"><em>(February 27, 2018)</em></span>		
			<p>Last week I had to abandon my projects because I got a bad flu. Now when I can work again, I still have some symptoms of seasonal allergy. I hate how illnesses are keeping me from working hard to achieve my goals. There are people who can push themselves to work even when they do not have the optimal health. Though I admire their abilities, I don't think it's the best tactic to become successful. Yes, you can push yourself through your headache, flu or lack of sleep to achieve career success. But in the process, you are losing your health, which is more important than anything else. I myself want to achieve both physical, mental and  professional success. Instead of ignoring one and focus on another, I want to focus on my physical health first. Feeling energized and healthy will be the first ingredient to achieve other great things. Some of the habits I'm having and not having are keeping me from optimal performance:</p>

			<p>
				<ol>
					<li>Exercise at least 20 minutes a day</li>
					<li>Eliminate chocolate bars, candies, and other refine sugar intakes</li>
					<li>Grow and make wheatgrass juice</li>
					<li>Practice yogic breathing daily</li>
					<li>Meditate before going to bed</li>
					<li>Drink 1 bottle of water (with added lemon juice) from 8AM to 6PM</li>
				</ol>
			</p>
